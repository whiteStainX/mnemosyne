                Infinite Mac is a project by
                <a href="https://persistent.info">Mihai Parparita</a> to make
                classic Mac and NeXT emulation easily accessible. It uses

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
            <p>
                The welcome document or Stickies in each machine has
                instructions. For a demo of the kinds of capabilities the
                emulators have, see
                <a

                >.
            </p>

            <h3>How do I get files and out?</h3>
            <p>
                Most emulated Macs (System 7 to Mac OS 9.0.4) have a "The
                Outside World" drive on the desktop. Files dragged into the
                browser window will appear in the “Downloads” folder, and files
                placed in the “Uploads” folder will be downloaded to your
                computer. To preserve resource forks when dragging in files from
                modern macOS, you'll need to first archive the file or older
                into a .zip. See
                <a
                    href="https://blog.persistent.info/2025/09/infinite-mac-resource-forks.html"

                for details.
            </p>

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>
                To learn more, including how it was built, see

            <h3>Why is it called Infinite Mac?</h3>
            <p>
                Partly because it evokes
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Infinite_Loop_campus"
                    >Infinite Loop</a
                >, partly because porting something to the web means it can be
                run on an almost infinite number of devices, and partly because
                it's a

                    href="https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-forever-project.html"

                >.
            </p>

            <h3>Why is NeXTStep included?</h3>
            <p>
                It's a contemporary of classic Mac OS and an ancestor of Mac OS
                X.
            </p>

            <h3 class="macosx-faq">Why is Mac OS X so slow?</h3>
            <p>
                Mac OS X is a much more resource-intensive operating system than
                classic Mac OS (it also ran rather slowly on real early 2000s
                hardware). It's possible that adding QEMU as an emulator option
                will improve performance. You can subscribe to
                <a href="https://github.com/mihaip/infinite-mac/issues/72"
                    >GitHub issue #72</a
                >
                to get updates on any QEMU-related progress.
            </p>

            <h3>What about DOS or Windows? Apple II? ProDOS? BeOS?</h3>

            <p>
                The project is focused on classic Macintosh and adjacent
                systems, but if you're interested in other operating systems,
                you can check out
                <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/">PCjs</a> or
                <a href="https://copy.sh/v86/">Virtual x86</a> for Windows, and
                <a href="https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple2/">Apple ][js</a>
                for ProDOS.
            </p>

            <h3>Do you have a web counter?</h3>
            <p>
                Ah, the staple of mid-90s personal pages. Sort of –
                <span class="counter"></span> emulated Mac instances have been
                started since the site debuted.
            </p>

            <h3>How can I provide feedback?</h3>
            <p>
                You can reach Mihai
                <a class="email">via email</a> or
                <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@mihaip">@mihaip@hachyderm.io</a>.

            <h3>How can I support the project?</h3>
            <p>
                Using it, sharing it, and giving feedback is the best way. If

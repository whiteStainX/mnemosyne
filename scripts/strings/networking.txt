Networking is supported!

You can use the “Customize…” option before starting to join a virtual AppleTalk zone. All emulated Macs using the same zone name should be able to see each other.

Files can be shared between instances, and multi-player games like Marathon, Bolo and Strategic Conquest should also work.

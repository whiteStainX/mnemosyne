The contents of Saved HD are saved in your browser's local storage. You can use this disk to save data across Infinite Mac sessions.

Tips:
• To ensure that the disk is not corrupted, shut down the emulated Mac before leaving a session.
• The contents can be exported and imported from the emulator settings dialog, to allow backups and sharing across browsers and machines.
• The contents can also be exported to a .dsk disk image file, so that they can be used in Basilisk II, SheepShaver and other native emulators.
• You can install system software on Saved HD (either by copying it from an existing disk or via a System Software CD-ROM from the library). It can then be used as a startup disk (if running a custom instance with no other disks), allowing custom extensions and control panels to be installed and persisted across sessions.
• The same disk is mounted in all instances, so it's also a way to move data from one to system disk to another.
